# discord-winclassic
A theme i made for Discord using stuff from 98.css.

98.css: https://jdan.github.io/98.css/

UPDATE: Discord changed alot of classes on canary resulting in this theme being very broken on it so use stable or ptb with this theme

This also applies to my SOW discord theme

i'm currently developing a fix for both themes
